# Script to get usage counts from logs for Riverwalk Jazz.  

As of Jan 2016, the SoundExchange reporting requirements for SUL related to our statutory license as a noncommercial webcaster of the Riverwalk Jazz collection online requires us to prepare monthly reports on the number of “performances” of each "song" ie, each time a particular "song" is streamed.

This script will gather that usage data from the hourly logs that are created and stored on media@libstream.stanford.edu/var/log/ezstream/.

Inputs to the script would reflect the reporting time period.
